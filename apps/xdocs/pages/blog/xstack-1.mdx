Introducing XStack, the Web3 stack - realized. XStack consists of two primary elements: XBallot and XSpace.

## XBallot: All-in-one DAO-management platform

XBallot is an all-in-one DAO-management platform for Web3 communities. Its features include:

- [**On-Chain Operations**](#on-chain-operations): All actions within XBallot are performed entirely on-chain, offering unmatched transparency, security, and efficiency for decentralized governance.
- [**Account Registrar**](#account-registrar): Create unique profiles and DAO spaces with the integrated, on-chain Account Registrar, providing an all-encompassing platform for seamless DAO management.
- [**Community Forums**](#community-forums): On-chain Community Forums facilitate dynamic and interactive governance discussions, controlled by token-gated access for refined community management.
- [**Social Engagement**](#social-engagement): Community forums allow for long-form posts and shorter tweet-style blasts, enabling likeable, shareable, and engaging content, all managed entirely on-chain.

XBallot is also integrated with industry leaders like [Infura](https://infura.io/), [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/), [SubQuery](https://www.subquery.network/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), and [AWS Activate](https://aws.amazon.com/activate/) to ensure a robust, reliable, and efficient DAO management platform.

XSpace is the no-code, chain-agnostic successor to website builders, designed to facilitate seamless interaction with the Web3 ecosystem.
