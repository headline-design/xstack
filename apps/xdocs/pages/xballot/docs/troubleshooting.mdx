# XBallot API Troubleshooting

Interacting with APIs can sometimes lead to unexpected results or issues. This guide aims to address common problems you might encounter while using the XBallot API and suggest solutions to resolve them.

## Understanding HTTP Status Codes

When making requests to the XBallot API, you may encounter various HTTP status codes. Below are the most common ones you might come across:

- 200 OK: The request was successful.
- 400 Bad Request: Your request is invalid or improperly formatted.
- 401 Unauthorized: Your API key is wrong or you don't have the necessary permissions.
- 403 Forbidden: You're authenticated but do not have access to what you're trying to do.
- 404 Not Found: The resource you're trying to access could not be found on the server.
- 500 Internal Server Error: Something has gone wrong on the server side.

## Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: I'm getting a 400 Bad Request error.
This usually means that the server was unable to understand your request due to invalid syntax.

**Solution**:
Ensure that your request is properly formatted. This might involve checking your endpoint path, query parameters, or request body for errors.

**Issue**: I'm receiving a 401 Unauthorized error.
This means the request lacks valid authentication credentials.

**Solution**:
Ensure that you are providing the correct API key and that it has the necessary permissions to access the resource.

**Issue**: I keep getting a 403 Forbidden error.
A 403 Forbidden error means you're authenticated but do not have access to the resource.

**Solution**:
Make sure your account has the necessary permissions to access the resource.

**Issue**: I'm seeing a 404 Not Found error.
This implies that the server can't find the requested resource. This could happen if the resource does not exist, or if there was a typo in the resource name or id in the path.

**Solution**:
Verify the endpoint and resource id. Make sure the resource you're trying to access actually exists.

**Issue**: I encountered a 500 Internal Server Error.
This means something has gone wrong on the server side.

**Solution**:
In most cases, you'll have to contact XBallot's support. If you repeatedly see this error, it might be helpful to provide them with the exact request that is causing the issue.

## General Tips

- Always ensure your API keys are kept secure. Do not expose them in any publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, etc.
- Make sure that you are using the correct HTTP methods for your requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc.).
- Ensure that your requests are going to the correct base URL for the XBallot API.
- Use appropriate headers for your API requests, such as Content-Type and Accept.
- When encountering errors, the response body may contain more information about what went wrong. Always check this when troubleshooting.
- Remember that APIs are designed to work for a wide range of clients, so it's important to read the documentation and understand how the API is supposed to work. If you're stuck, don't hesitate to reach out to XBallot support or consult with the community.
